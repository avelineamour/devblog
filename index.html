        <h1 id="luxe-boutique">Luxe Boutique: Building an E-Commerce Rails Application</h1>
        <span>June 24th, 2018</span>
        <p class="blogtext">
          Today I wrapped up my first Rails web application. Having previously created a Sinatra web app, aspects of this project such as routing, user authentication, and CRUD were familiar, but Rails, being such a large framework with established conventions that were new to me, still presented many challenges. In my last project, I learned the value of planning and implementing models and migrations right away. So I made sure to apply that to this one. I took on some other challenges in building this project such as configuring it with a PostgresSQL database in anticipation of deploying it to Heroku.<br /><br />

          I spent the first few days reviewing the omniauth process so I could implement that first and get it out of the way as well as planning out my models and ActiveRecord relationships. ActiveRecord table joins and <code>has_many, through:</code> relationships are not my fort√©. I frequently joke that they are mental gymnastics for me. And that's ok. It just takes me more time to visualize. So I stared, I thought, I drew, and connected the dots until it all made sense. I wrote the migrations for each model in my Bear app as well as describing the relationships of each model. I wrote user experience flows detailing what I expected to happen. User clicks this, then this happens, then they are presented with this form. Using visualization and putting myself in the user's shoes instead of trying to abstractly design this from the back end was helpful. <br /><br />

          When I finished planning, I merely had to copy the code I'd already written for myself, thus alleviating a lot of the stress of setting up models and the db. My next step, which I would recommend to anyone building a Rails application was to set up the <code>nav</code> as I intended it to be with <code>home</code>, <code>log in</code>, <code>sign up</code>, <code>log out</code>, <code>shop</code>, and <code>cart</code>. I set up each page that those directed to with a quick <code>h1</code> and a word describing that page just to get the basic routing/page flow down without complexity. In the beginning, I wanted to make sure my user was logged in and it had grabbed the name and email properly so I displayed the <code>current_user</code> name, email and <code>logged_in?</code> on the home page to confirm. I have seen my classmates struggle in setting up their applications and would recommend to anyone who struggles to zoom out and set yourself up with the big picture before trying to go in and do detail work. I say this as someone often guilty of this, but who is trying to streamline their own process. <br /><br />

          After I got user auth working, including with facebook, I seeded my database with a few items for the shop and began working on the cart functionality. I am happy to say that from there, everything followed a logical order. It was not without obstacles, though. One thing that was extremely important for me in building this was that it was as close to a real application as possible. I could have taken it a lot farther in order to satisfy that goal, but opted to use discretion. What was important was that it showcased my ability to build an application that eventually would or could be used and had a few core features that were important to me, like user reviews displayed with stars for example. <br /><br />

          One of these important features was the cart working whether logged in or out. In a real online store, you can add items to your cart that get stored in the session, so I set that up with the ability to modify the quantity as well. To check out, the user must be logged in. Once you log in, the <code>session[:cart]</code> items get associated to you, while remaining in the session. The cart show page iterates over the <code>session[:cart]</code>, which was intentional because that way, whether you're logged in or out, it shows the items you've added. I could have done some if else logic there, but I saw this as the simplest way. <br /><br />

          It was a challenge working to modify the quantities in both the session and the current user's associated cart items at first. When I went to show my dad my project, the quantity wasn't updating correctly. There were several places in my code where I looked for a <code>cart_item</code> by <code>item_id</code>, but failed to realize that many <code>cart_items</code> get created with respective <code>item_id</code> and that finding one is just grabbing the first one in the db as a whole and not out of the users collection. Once I fixed those lines of code, my quantity function worked again and order was restored in the galaxy! Or ... in my project.<br /><br />

          One thing I'm proud of is that I saved styling and css for last! In my Sinatra project I felt compelled to style first. This was stressful. Rails also provides a much more organized way to approach styling with respective stylesheets for each controller. The joy in building applications like this for me is in the design. The functionality is all in service to that. That's just how I feel about websites and web apps in general. Make them work, but make them clean, usable, and beautiful as well. I'm proud to say I designed and styled this application from scratch and designed a custom logo as well.<br /><br />

          In conclusion, I believe this application exemplifies my skills in graphic and web design, my ability to pause, to plan, to approach a task with a big picture view (start big, then zoom in), to approach things in an organized manner, abstract things away and be <strong>DRY</strong>, and finally to place due consideration on user experience. While I do not believe my project to be without flaws or room for improvement, nor do I expect it to be as a new Ruby engineer, I do believe it to be a solid and promising start to a developer career and the work I put into it reflects my desire to do so. I am very grateful to the Flatiron School for teaching us Rails and so excited to proceed to JavaScript to take future projects to the next level! Please see the demo video for more details on features.<br /><br /><br />

        <h1 id="andromeda-project">Creating My First Sinatra Web Application</h1>
        <span>April 26th, 2018</span>
        <p class="blogtext">

        Today I finished my first Sinatra Web Application <a href="https://github.com/avelineamour/andromeda-project">The Andromeda Project</a>.<br /><br />

            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/266735639?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />

        I was really excited to start this project because it was my first multi-page site, first time using a database, and first time programming a website with Ruby. I learned basic HTML and css at Codecademy, which is what this blog was built with, but had always been curious about bigger applications. Thankfully the preceding <a href="https://learn.co/">Learn.co</a> labs, though challenging, were very helpful in prepping us to build our own Sinatra project.<br /><br />

        I began with planning on paper. I'm a visual learner and ActiveRecord associations and join tables have been difficult for me to wrap my mind around. I chose to base my project around the fictional narrative that in the future, we have built an FTL (faster-than-light) drive that has allowed us to explore and map out the Andromeda Galaxy. Before I embarked on my developer journey, I had always said I wanted to be a programmer and/or work on something to do with space. For a long time, that was all talk and no action, but now having put action behind my goals, I thought it would be cool to bring it full circle and apply my programming to something space themed. Realistically, I know this project will not be used for anything, but rather serves as practice and evidence of what I can do. In the future I may choose something more applicable in a work environment (it might be a while before we figure out that FTL drive).<br /><br />

        After I had planned out my models -- a User having many Planets and a Planet having many Aliens, I got to work on designing. For me, design is everything. Design is my passion in life and I am personally very sensitive to the aesthetics of things around me and things on the web especially. I believe that good design is important to user experience and that it drastically improves user experience. I took the opportunity to use and essentially learn a new program -- Adobe XD (Experience Design). I was able to design each page and link pages to pages so that I could preview the application flow. This greatly helped position me to start my project because in the beginning I felt overwhelmed by the task and all the pages that there were. In the beginning, I was overly ambitious and intended to add models for Black Holes and Nebulae, but quickly realized that was too much for this particular project.<br /><br />

        Once the pages were roughly designed, I started building them out. I created controllers and the views for each model and began working on the html/css for one page at a time, just fleshing out the basics and putting placeholders in for where the names of Users, Planets, and Aliens would be dynamically displayed. Later, I created the tables. To be honest, the process was a bit chaotic. I had a neuropsych evaluation a few years ago and one of the things we discovered from the IQ test was that my approach to tasks was a bit chaotic and inefficient even though I got to the same end. I can definitely see that play out when it comes to big projects like this. In the end, I made it there, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd create my tables and models first, seed some data early, flesh out all of the routes in the proper order on each controller, and then worry about the html and css after.<br /><br />

        I learned quite a lot on this project. I learned about validations and being able to validate the presence and uniqueness of certain inputs in the model IE: <code>validates :username, :email, uniqueness: true</code> or <code>validates :username, :email, :password, presence: true</code>. This was really useful for my project because it prevented any objects from being saved to the database which didn't have unique names or missing fields. In the previous labs, we had used <code>rack-flash</code> to display error messages based on blank inputs and I wasn't thinking much farther along than that. During the project, I realized there were many other things to verify-- what if the username was taken? What if the password was wrong? What if the object existed already? So the project became a process of individually approaching those issues and coming up with solutions, which was fun and interesting.<br /><br />

        I ran into a few frustrations-- namely learning that if one of the controllers inheriting from <code>ApplicationController</code> was named alphabetically higher IE: my <code>AliensController</code>, it would not know about its parent class and also that the order of the controllers in the <code>config.ru</code> file was important-- specifically that <code>UsersController</code> should be first. The latter actually sent me on a 3 hour goose chase trying to figure out why my flash messages stopped working. That was it. The worst part was at the end, realizing I had not set up my associations properly, the main goal and requirement of this project. Thankfully, I was not far off from the solution and only had to modify a few things. I had to change the User model to having many Aliens <strong>through</strong> Planets and also give Planets a <code>user_id</code>. Because Aliens already had a <code>planet_id</code> column, they were associated with a User through Planets. I also realized I hadn't programmed in a way for the data to be unique to each user, which I would not have been able to do without the former associations being established. Now that Planets had a <code>user_id</code>, when a User created a Planet, they would at that point be logged in, so the <code>user_id</code> given to Planet could be set with <code>current_user.id</code> which I made a helper method for called <code>user_id</code>.<br /><br />

        Overall this was a very challenging, fun, and cool project and I am very proud of it.




        <h1 id="rubygem">Creating My First CLI Ruby Gem</h1>
        <span>March 7th, 2018</span>
        <p class="blogtext">

          It's official. I have published my first <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/love_of_tea">Ruby Gem</a> on RubyGems.org. It was a challenging process, but I am proud of the end result.<br /><br />

            <iframe id ="gemdemo" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPW-h0M0Css" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />

          When I started this project I felt a little lost, but thankfully we had access to some great resources for getting started. I followed along with Avi's walkthrough video, which got me set up with my file structure via <code>bundle gem</code>. I quickly realized the .rb file that was added to the lib folder was functioning as an environment.rb file, so I made a config folder with an environment.rb and required all my lib files from there. That had pretty much been the pattern in labs so far and I like the idea of an environment file.<br /><br />

          I should say now that way ahead of time I had chosen what website I was going to scrape and what my program would do. I chose the <a href="https://www.rishi-tea.com/">Rishi Tea</a> website where I purchase my own Jasmine Pearls and other types of tea. I regard them very highly. I knew I wanted my program to match people based on the type of tea and that caffeine levels could be gleaned by type, so I'd program something in to do with that. In the beginning I just stubbed out the basics of the CLI. Without having classes yet I stubbed out my questions and inputs to make sure it was working as intended. Naturally, it became more complex over time. It was very comforting getting it to basically do what I wanted it to do before it had the data. That meant I could relax and focus on the classes.<br /><br />

          Inspired by previous Learn.co labs, I decided to have a Scraper class do the scraping and to grab the info for each tea and put it in a hash. Then I'd feed that to a Tea class to instantiate new Tea objects. Each key in the hash represented an attribute of the tea-- type, name, description, price, and URL. That all went quite well. The initial struggle was in determining where to delegate certain responsibilities and ultimately I went with what felt the most natural.<br /><br />

          The Tea class has several class methods that will take a url and then call on the scraping class method in the Scraper class to scrape that URL. Then for each hash grabbed by the Scraper, it will instantiate a new instance of itself (being the Tea) with the hash passed in as an argument. The initialize method in the Tea class takes care of assigning the instance variables or attributes of the teas. That all made sense to me and was great. I had a moment of uncertainty as to where to actually call them, as they were just methods, available for use, but not having been used yet. I decided to to call them in the initialize method of the CLI class. That way every time a CLI object is instantiated (only happens once in the program) it loads up all the teas from the 5 tea urls that were provided to it (white, green, black, herbal, chai) and creates Tea objects for use in the program. I made methods to create arrays of each type from the class variable <code>@@all</code>, ultimately using those to list the teas.<br /><br />

          The main struggle for me in this whole process was learning what to do in my gemspec and getting the gem working once it was built and pushed. I had no idea what spec.executables meant, the fact that I had to specify the files in the project to spec.files, or how to specify the command to run my program as an actual gem. Early on, the program was done and running great locally. I actually went back and added functionality inspired by my classmates. I had no cart function at first or way of handling invalid inputs for the prompts after the very first prompt. I added that in and was very proud of my program and then I <strong>couldn't get it working</strong> as a gem. It took me a whole day before it worked with <code>gem install</code>. Bit by bit I did figure it out with the help of my classmates and reading documentation. I pushed 16 versions of my gem before it worked, which it now does. It wasn't able to load the lib files and in the end, I'm not sure what I did that made it work. What I do know is it was a very small detail and only the gem version of it seemed to care how I had required my files, whereas locally it wasn't a problem. I tried changing my <code>require_relative</code> lines to not have .rb on the end and that's the point at which it seemed to work. They were all listed properly in environment, which was required by the bin file and for some reason were not loading. This is one of those instances where I kept trying so many things that when it actually worked, I was confused. I'm disappointed to say I can't pinpoint it, but happy I have a blueprint of a working gem for the future. The thing with testing your gem is it's not enough for it to work locally. You have to push it to RubyGems and then install it and test it. Meanwhile, people are downloading your gem! I learned the <code>gem yank</code> command during this and ultimately yanked all the versions that didn't work.<br /><br />

          Bottom line-- I did it. It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot! Feel free to install and run my gem with <code>gem install love_of_tea</code> and the command <code>loveoftea</code>.




        <h1 id="productivity">Productivity & Growth Hacks</h1>
        <span>January 1st, 2018</span>
        <p class="blogtext">

          If you are a student of the Flatiron School, of code, or of life, you will likely need a few tools at your disposal to stay organized, take notes, track progress, and remain sane. There are many apps out there, but I'm going to share the ones that I find the most helpful at the moment and why. One thing they all have in common is really great design. As a strong advocate of good UI, this makes me happy and I hope they will make you happy too!<br /><br />

          The first one, which I absolutely recommend if you are learning to code is <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear Writer for Mac</a>. Sorry Windows users, this one is Mac only, but it is beautiful. The interface is sleek and simple, it allows for your standard formatting--headers, bulleted lists, numbered lists, checkboxes. etc. but one great feature is code blocks. You can do a single line <code>snippet</code> or a full code block. Within the code block, you can specify your language after the <code>```</code> for proper syntax highlighting. What I like about Bear besides the UI and formatting options is it autosaves, all your notes are visible and accessible from the sidebar, a quick search will allow you to find things quick, and you can use hashtags to make categorizing your notes even easier, for example #code or #ruby.
          <br /><br />
          <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"><img src="./resources/images/bearwriter.png" /></a><br /><br />

          The second one is <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc">Forest</a>. One thing I learned from the Flatiron School is the Pomodoro Technique-- 25 minute timers to focus on a task with no distractions, followed by a 5 minute break. Now, you could set timers on your phone, but that's no fun because to track what you got done, you'd have to manually log it elsewhere. There are many Pomodoro apps out there that allow you to store information on what you did, but why not do it with a little extra incentive? On the Forest mobile app, when you start a session, it plants a tree. If you leave the app, your tree dies. When you finish, you get coins to buy new trees and can mark down what you did. As the day goes on, you build a forest. It's incentivizing to look at your forest and try to make it lusher!<br /><br />

          <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc"><img src="./resources/images/forest.png" /></a><br /><br />

          The third is a personal new favorite of mine: <a href="http://griddiaryapp.com/en/">Grid Diary</a>. This is another mobile app. It's a similar concept to Day One and other daily journaling apps, but this is the best one I've found so far and the UI is phenomenal. It sets up your daily journal entries as a grid with boxes that pose a question. You can choose what and how many questions you want to answer on any given day and remove or swap out the rest. You mark down the weather and your mood for the day and can add photos if you like. Every time you press something it makes a little noise and that makes me happy. There are a number of views-- entries, grids, questions, and photos, so you can get quick overview of your recent data. It's hard to explain without using it, so go download it! It's great to be recording the lessons you've done each day to track your progress, as well as other things you might be proud of or not so proud of and want to do better with the following day. <br /><br />

          <a href="http://griddiaryapp.com/en/"><img src="./resources/images/grid.png" /></a><br /><br />

          The last app I will recommend is <a href="https://www.aurahealth.io">Aura</a>. If you're thinking, "I'm a coder, not a monk", then you've already confirmed needing a mindfulness practice. Mindfulness is for everybody. It is about taking a moment to relax your body and mind. When sitting at a computer long hours and problem solving, stress can mount easily. Even if you start with 3-5 minutes a day, that 3-5 minutes could end up being the most impactful part of your day. In physics, an object in motion stays in motion unless interrupted. Meditating is like interrupting your mind in motion. It gives you a chance to become aware of the tension in your body and to check in with yourself. An app that gives you guided meditations makes it easier to do.<br /><br />

          I noticed a few Learn.co students asking around about flexbox, so decided to make a video tutorial giving a basic introduction to flexbox. In this lesson, we cover:
          <ul class="ul">
            <li>Displaying Parent Container as <pre><code>flex</code></pre></li>
            <li>Orienting Flex Items on Horizontal Axis With <pre><code>justify-content</code></pre></li>
              <ul>
                <li><pre><code>flex-start</code></pre> (default)</li>
                <li><pre><code>flex-end</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>center</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>space-around</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>space-between</code></pre></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Orienting Flex Items on Vertical Axis With <pre><code>align-items</code></pre></li>
              <ul>
                <li><pre><code>flex-start</code></pre> (default)</li>
                <li><pre><code>flex-end</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>center</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>space-around</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>space-between</code></pre></li>
                <li><pre><code>baseline</code></pre></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Flex Items Can Be Flex Containers</li>
            <li>Rows (default) vs Columns With <pre><code>flex-direction</code></pre></li>
          </ul>

        <h1 id="dev">My Intro to Web Development</h1>
        <span>November 20th, 2017</span>
        <p class="blogtext">
          I first became interested in web development when I was seven years old. I learned basic HTML through Neopets, which had HTML lessons at the time and was geared towards kids. My main reason for learning was so I could make a guild page, a common practice on the site at the time. I've always been an aesthetically oriented person and enjoy the process of designing beautiful websites that serve a greater purpose. My dad is a senior network engineer and we had the original Apple computer in our house, followed by the colored iMacs and iBooks. He helped me self-host my site using dynDNS. I called it "smileyz". I set background and font colors and added some images, likely of cats. I remember my first grade computer teacher looking at me confused when I showed it to him. In the time between then and now, I have been the go-to tech person for friends and coworkers, but did not continue with coding.<br /><br />

          For the past couple years, I have owned a business-- a private practice in orthopedic massage therapy. I've done my own marketing and consider a business' website to be the most integral aspect of their representation. Web presence and brand can be very powerful. I once read a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subliminal-Your-Unconscious-Rules-Behavior/dp/0307472256">Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior</a> that demonstrates through scientific studies how subconscious factors influence perception. They can influence the amount of value we attribute to something, such as a brand. Today many companies and blogs are design conscious, so it's important to keep up. I was very excited to design my website, but did not know how to do it from scratch at the time, so I used Squarespace (<a href="https://www.satyaorthopedic.com">See Here: Satya Orthopedic</a>). I found that when it came to anything visual pertaining to my business that I wanted to do everything myself. I had no Adobe or design experience, but I learned some basics and made my own automated email templates, instagram templates, and business cards. I was having a lot of fun and that inspired me to start a blog.<br /><br />

          Design for me is an act for self expression that goes hand in hand with expressing my thoughts and feelings. In early 2017 I created a blog with a name and an underlying concept, but wanted to have more control over the nuances of the design before releasing it to the world. I put it on pause and took the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-websites-from-scratch?ubv=upgrdsbws">Build Websites from Scratch Pro Intensive</a> course through Codecademy and thus my journey into web development began. It crystallized how much I enjoy it and how much more I want to learn, including how the back end functions and how I could create a site from scratch that took in data like email lists, user info, etc. After Build Websites, I started Build Front End Web Apps From Scratch (also through Codecademy) and began learning JavaScript. Finally, in November 2017 I began Flatiron's Online Web Development program, which is what the rest of this blog will document.<br /><br />
