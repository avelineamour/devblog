# Dev Blog

A single page blog dedicated to discussing my learning process as a developer at Flatiron School. Flatiron provides the opportunity to use their blog platform, but I opted to build one from scratch as a portfolio project and to improve the UX for myself. Custom design, built with flexbox (no bootstrap except Font Awesome buttons), mobile responsive. Hamburger menu is css. I intend to update it with jQuery and improve the mobile experience once I go through the Javascript unit at Flatiron and have more time to dedicate to implementing/properly understanding jQuery.
